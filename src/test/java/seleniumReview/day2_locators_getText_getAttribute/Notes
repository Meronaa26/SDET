Selenium Locators
help us locate  web elements using SELENIUM WEBDRIVER
Methods coming from selenium library that helps us find WebElement
we have 8 locators


1==>linkText(" the text of the link")
     will look through all of the links' texts on the page and will return the link with matching text.
     this link only will work on links
2==> partialLinkText
     will be looking for PARTIAL TEXT MATCH
     similar to .contains method .java

     ctrl+shift

3==>name
    looks through the html code and returns the matching "name" attribute value

4==>id
    very similar to name locator
    id is unique to each web element
    sometimes id can be dynamic

5==> className
    very similar to name and id
    it uses "class" attribute value
6==> tagName
   locating elements using their tag names


getText() ==> it gets the text of given Webelement
              only able to return the text that is in between the OPENING TAG  and CLOSING TAG
              doesn't accept any argument
              return type is : String
getAttribute(" takes an attribute") ==> method will get the given attribute value
                                 is only able to read inside of the <>
                                 it will find the matching attribute name and return the value



findElement()==> finds and returns a SINGLE web element
                  comes from selenium library
                  NoSuchElementException ==>
                                         locator might not be correct
                                         page is not loaded
                                         BrowserDriver is not on the same page with the browser



8==> cssSelector ==> will be able to locate with any of the attribute  provided inside the tag
                     we are not just limited to mane, id........
                     able to create CUSTOM locators
     SYNTAX=1        tagname[attribute='value]
                     a[id='uh7']
                     a[name='bb95]
                     a[href='http...']

      SYNTAX=2  only use id or class
                tagname#idvalue    ==># stand for id attribute
                tagname.classvalue   ==>.stands for class attribute
                a#uh7
                a.kk99


.isDisplayed()==> will verify if the method on the page is diplayed
                  boolean type
                  doesn't accept any arguments
                  used on already located webelement



8==> XPATH
          create custom locator using any given attribute
          2 types
                1==> absolute xpath starts with single /
                      starts from the root element in html page
                      usually it is very long and not dependable ==> not recommended to use
                      it is not stable
                      if there is any minimal change happen in the html it will not work
                2==>dynamic xpath  starts with //
                           you can start anywhere in html page ==> very dependable and useful
                           only time that doesn't work is only when attribute value you use is changed
                           //a[@name='bb95']
                           COMMONLY USED XPATH
                            1==>//tagname[@attribute='value']
                            2==>//tagname[contains(@attribute,'value')]
                            3==>tagname[.='text']
                            4==>//*[attribute='value']



HOW TO MOVE FROM PARENT TO CHILD USING CSS SELECTOR  ==> when we can not locate  a unique attribute/value and we can locate the parent and move down to child
 example==> div[id='content']>div>h2
           tagname[attribute='value']> childtagname
 WE CAN NOT DO FROM CHILD TO PARENT USING CSS BUT WITH XPATH(/..)

//h2[.='**]/..
